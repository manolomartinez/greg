#
# Placeholders ###############################################################
#
# Througout this config file, you can use several placeholders to construct
# strings that make reference to the entry you are currently downloading, the
# podcast name, etc. At the moment, these are the available placeholders:
# 
# {link} the download link of the podcast entry
# {filename} the name of the file to be downloaded (which need not be the name
# under which you will save it locally)
# {directory} the directory which the file is to be downloaded to
# {fullpath} the concatenation of directory and filename
# {title} the title of the podcast entry
# {filename_title} just like {title}, but leaving only alphanumeric characters 
# and the underscore, so as to have a sane filename.
# {date} the date of the podcast entry
# {podcasttitle} the title of the podcast 
# {filename_podcasttitle} see above.
# {name} the name you use to refer to the podcast in greg
# {subtitle} a description of the feed
# {entrysummary} a summary of the podcast entry
#
# If you have chosen to install BeautifulSoup, which is an optional dependency,
# {subtitle} and {summary} will be converted from html to text. Otherwise, they
# will show the original html, sanitized by feedparser.
#
# Whenever you use a placeholder in this configfile, it will be substituted by
# whatever it refers to. The {date} placeholder, by default, will be
# substituted by the entry date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. If you want to change
# this, you can use the field date_format to specify a different format. For
# example, use
#
# date_format = %d/%m/%y
#
# if you want {date} to be substituted by the entry date as dd/mm/yy.
# The syntax here is that of Python's strftime().
#
##############################################################################
#
# The option under [DEFAULT] will be applied to all feeds, unless some specific
# feed configuration overrules it. For example, if the download directory is 
# "~/Podcasts", all feeds will be downloaded to this directory except for those
# that have a different Download directory in their section.

[DEFAULT] 

# The following gives the name of the directory in which greg will store the 
# information about feeds and the latest downloaded issues. This is the only 
# option that cannot be overriden by specific podcasts -- that is, any "Data 
# directory" field in a section below will not be read.

Data directory = ~/.local/share/greg/data

# The following gives the name of the file in which greg will store downloaded 
# podcasts

Download directory = ~/Podcasts/

# For the following option, you can choose 
#   "no" (the feed will be downloaded directly to the download directory)
#   "yes" (the feed will be downloaded to its own directory)

Create subdirectory = no

# If you choose "yes", you can provide a name for the subdirectory with
# subdirectory_name. This name can include any of the placeholders described
# above -- except for {directory} or {fullpath}, of course. For example:
#
# subdirectory_name = {podcasttitle}
#
### Tagging ##################################################################
#
# Answering "yes" to the following option will make greg fill out podcast 
# metadata, using the podcast title as Artist, and the entry title as Title. This
# is probably most useful as an option to specific podcasts; those that are not 
# correctly tagged at origin.

Tag = no

# You can specify which metadata greg should fill out. The available options
# are:
#
# tag_title
# tag_artist 
# tag_date 
# tag_album-artist 
# tag_album 
# tag_track 
# tag_track-total
# tag_disc 
# tag_disc-total
# tag_grouping 
# tag_composer 
# tag_genre 
# tag_comment 
# tag_picture
# tag_sort-title 
# tag_sort-artist
# tag_sort-album-artist 
# tag_sort-album
# tag_sort-composer
#
# the syntax you need to use is, e.g.
#
# tag_title = Some text, possibly including, or just being, a {placeholder}
#
# where the available placeholders are described above.
#
# So, 
#
# tag_artist = {title}
#
# will fill the artist tag with the title of the entry. The default is

tag_artist = {podcasttitle}
tag_title = {title}
tag_genre = Podcast

# Finally, if you are using a custom download handler (see below), you need to tell
# greg how to figure out the name of the podcast files, using the file_to_tag
# option. For example if your
# download handler saves podcasts under a name such as "entry title.ogg", you
# will need to add the following to the podcast's config section:
#
# file_to_tag = {entry}.ogg
#
###############################################################################
#
# The following option defines how many podcasts should Greg download in its 
# first sync. Any integer will do; e.g., 
#
# firstsync = 1
#
# means that Greg will only download the latest podcast. Also,
#
# firstsync = all
#
# asks Greg to download every available podcast.
#
#
firstsync = 1
#
###############################################################################
#
# The following option expects a list of words (separated by commas) which would
# be part of the mime-type of the desired enclosures. That is, if the feed is a
# video podcast you would have here
#
# mime = video
#
# If the feed has both video and audio enclosures, and you want them both, 
# you'll add
#
# mime = audio, video
#
# The default is to download only audio files. Thus,
#
mime = audio
#
###############################################################################
#
# The following option provides a custom download handler. It expects a shell 
# command, in which you can use the placeholders enumerated above.
#
# For example, if you want to use wget to download your podcasts, you might use
#
# downloadhandler = wget {link} -P {directory}
#
# The following special case simply instructs greg to download the podcast 
# itself.
#
downloadhandler = greg
#
###############################################################################
#
# Some feeds are abnormal in that they don't use enclosures. The following
# option, when set to "yes", instructs greg to ignore enclosures and simply
# return the entry link as {link}. 
#
ignoreenclosures = no
#
################################################################################
#
# Some other feeds are abnormal in that they don't carry information about
# enclosure types. The following option, when set to "yes", instructs greg to
# ignore enclosure types and simply download every enclosure
#
notype = no
#
###############################################################################
#
# Finally, you don't need to download every issue of a podcast. You can specify
# a condition such that greg will download an issue if and only if the issue
# meets it. For example,
#
# filter = "BBC" in "{title}" and "Lennon" not in "{title}"
#
# The syntax here is Python's, but it should be straightforward: "and", "or" and
# "not" mean what they customarily mean, and "in" means that the string to its
# left is contained in the string to its right -- i.e., "BBC" is in "BBC News".
# 
##############################################################################
#
# In the local version of this file, now you can add sections for individual 
# feeds, if and when you need them. The name of the section should be the name 
# you are using to refer to the feed in greg (i.e., one of the names that "greg
# list" returns):
#
# [MyFeed1]
#
# Download directory = ~/Documents/MyFeed1
#
# Tag = yes
#
# [MyFeed2]
#
# etc.
#
# In the global version of this file (that is, /etc/greg.conf) sections for 
# individual feeds will not be read.
